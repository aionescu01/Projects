Bachelor's degree thesis project - a 2D top-down shooter game with a retro style that is made in Unity, also using Microsoft Visual Studio for C# programming and Adobe Photoshop for some image editing and creation of some images used in the game. It features complete documentation regarding the ideas behind the creation of the game, the conceptualization of the game, and explaining all the aspects and steps I took in making the project, while also mentioning further developments, ideas and other aspects all big projects have. I have treated this project in a very professional manner which shows my capabilities of working in other projects of even bigger magnitude, while being very interested to work and improve.
