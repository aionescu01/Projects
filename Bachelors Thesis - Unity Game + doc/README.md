Bachelor's degree thesis project - a 2D top-down shooter game with a retro style that is made in Unity, also using Microsoft Visual Studio for C# programming and Adobe Photoshop for some image editing and creation of some images used in the game. It features complete documentation regarding the ideas behind the creation of the game, the conceptualization of the game, and explaining all the aspects and steps I took in making the project, while also mentioning further developments, ideas and other aspects all big projects have. I have treated this project in a very professional manner which shows my capabilities of working in other projects of even bigger magnitude, while being very interested to work and improve.
The following paragraphs are from the abstract in the documentation, as I think it says everything that is needed to see at first glance about this project, and to understand more I think the doc should be read.

The world of video games is a highly popular refuge in todayâ€™s society, a new community where each person is free to do as they please, in their own way, as long as it brings them happiness, without being judged for their preferences or abilities. This applies not only to players but also to game developers, who are free to create whatever they imagine. Thus, I decided to create a game that, in some aspects, such as visually or with certain mechanics, reminds me of the games I played in my childhood, but also honours their legacy for me, which introduced me to this world that taught me so much and brought me so many great memories. 
  In this paper, I will present the process of creating a 2D top-down shooter game. The game is developed in the Unity game engine, and the coding is done using scripts in C#, primarily using object-oriented programming principles, utilizing the Microsoft Visual Studio development environment.
  The paper provides a detailed overview of the entire game development process, from conceptualizing an idea, to creating a workflow and work strategy, building the game environment, managing and integrating scripts with objects, designing and implementing game mechanics, the creative process of creating the visual interface and graphical elements of the game, leading to combining all these elements to create a complete game, testing it, and solving any issues that may arise, ultimately making a finished product that I am proud of. All these processes are based on academic concepts that have been acquired throughout my studies, including object-oriented programming, using and configuring a game engine, utilizing a development environment for coding, understanding and utilizing relevant documentation, debugging and troubleshooting, and even the process of writing this document. All of these elements have been crucial in the making of this project. Through these aspects, I have demonstrated the skills and knowledge acquired in the field of game development and have created an interactive and captivating experience for players.
  In conclusion, this academic project makes a valuable contribution to the field of
game development and highlights the skills and knowledge gained in implementing a 2D
top-down shooter game. The game offers an engaging experience and explores relevant
academic concepts, serving as a source of inspiration and learning for other developers
and researchers in the field of games.
