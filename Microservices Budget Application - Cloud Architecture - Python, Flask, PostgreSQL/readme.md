**Cloud-Native Microservices Budget Management Platform | Python, Flask, Docker, PostgreSQL**

Designed and implemented a comprehensive microservices-based budget management application featuring containerized services, independent scaling capabilities, and sophisticated inter-service communication patterns for financial transaction and budget management.

### Project Overview

This project demonstrates modern cloud-native development practices through a fully containerized microservices architecture. The application provides complete budget management functionality with separate, independently scalable services for authentication, transaction management, budget control, and real-time budget validation with automated alerting systems.

### System Architecture

**Microservices Design:**
- **Authentication Service:** JWT-based user authentication and authorization
- **Transaction Service:** Financial transaction management with real-time budget validation
- **Budget Service:** Budget limit management with configurable alert thresholds
- **Additional Services:** [Any other services like notification, reporting, etc.]

**Infrastructure Components:**
- **Containerization:** Docker containers for each microservice with optimized Dockerfiles
- **Orchestration:** Docker Compose for multi-container application deployment
- **Database Strategy:** Separate PostgreSQL databases for each service ensuring data isolation
- **Service Communication:** RESTful APIs with JWT token propagation between services

### Key Technical Achievements

**Microservices Architecture Implementation:**
- Designed loosely coupled services with clear separation of concerns
- Implemented service-to-service communication with proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Created independent deployment pipelines for each microservice
- Established database per service pattern for data independence and scalability

**Advanced Inter-Service Communication:**
```python
# Example: Transaction service communicating with Budget service
response = requests.get(
    f'{BUDGET_SERVICE_URL}/getlimit',
    json={'category': data['category']},
    headers={'Authorization': f'Bearer {jwt_token}'}
)
```
- **Synchronous Communication:** HTTP/REST APIs for real-time data validation
- **Authentication Propagation:** JWT token forwarding across service boundaries
- **Error Handling:** Graceful degradation when services are unavailable
- **Service Discovery:** Environment-based service URL configuration

**Database Architecture:**
- **Transaction Database:** Dedicated PostgreSQL instance for financial transaction data
- **Budget Database:** Separate PostgreSQL instance for budget limits and configurations
- **Data Isolation:** Each service manages its own data schema and migrations
- **Scalability:** Independent database scaling based on service-specific requirements

**Real-Time Budget Validation System:**
- **Dynamic Budget Checking:** Real-time validation against configured budget limits
- **Alert Thresholds:** Configurable percentage-based proximity alerts (default 90%)
- **Multi-Level Notifications:** 
  - Proximity alerts when approaching budget limits
  - Exceeded alerts when surpassing budget constraints
- **Cross-Service Validation:** Transaction service validates against budget service in real-time
