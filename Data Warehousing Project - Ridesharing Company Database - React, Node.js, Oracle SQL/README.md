**Code Architecture Highlights:**
```javascript
// Example of programmatic database creation with advanced features
const FCursa = sequelizeWarehouse.define("FCursa", {
  // Model definition with constraints and validations
}, {
  // Custom table creation with partitioning
  sync: async () => {
    await sequelizeWarehouse.query(`
      CREATE TABLE F_CURSA (...) 
      PARTITION BY RANGE (cod_timp) (...)
    `);
  }
});
```

### 3. Frontend Application Module
