// Example of distributed table creation with fragmentation
const FragmentedTable = sequelize.define("TableName", {
  // Table definition with distributed constraints
}, {
  // Custom fragmentation logic
  hooks: {
    afterSync: async () => {
      // Implement horizontal fragmentation
      await createHorizontalFragments();
      // Setup replication triggers
      await setupReplicationTriggers();
